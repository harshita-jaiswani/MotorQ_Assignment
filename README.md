This project is developed using MERN Stack.

It has server running on localhost 5000 and client running on localhost 3000.

MongoAtlas has been used for database collection(backend) and some dummy data has been feeded into the database using the script present in data generation folder.

In this assignment frontend is completed for the login/signUp page with all the functionalities.

SignUp page is using student add API and login page is using get student API.

And out of 7 APIs, 6 APIs are completed successfully.

I've also added the loading react component.

I got stucked in the last API but I surely look after this issue and try to learn how to do such complex tasks using mongodb and javascript. 



Some Screenshots of the frontend and backend..
